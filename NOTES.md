# P0: CRITICAL

# P1: MAJOR

- always see spec is missing plan warning, but this is the expected behavior

```
‚è∫ Analysis: This spec doesn't have an "Implementation Plan" section with tasks.

  The spec defines WHAT to build (worktree isolation) but doesn't break it down into implementation tasks.
  According to the decomposing-tasks skill, I need to extract tasks from an "Implementation Plan" section.
```

# P2: MINOR

# FOR LATER / SKIP FOR NOW

- add precompact hook for long running specs - we can output design-docs.md
- are we injecting the constitution/plan into intitial subagent prompt/context? it does a lot of looking around
