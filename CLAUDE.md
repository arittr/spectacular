# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Spectacular** is a Claude Code plugin that enables spec-anchored development with automatic parallel task execution. It extends the [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) plugin with commands and skills for feature specification, task decomposition, and parallel execution via git worktrees and git-spice stacked branches.

**Core Philosophy:**
- **Spec anchoring**: Every line of code traces back to spec + constitution
- **Automatic parallelization**: Independent tasks run simultaneously via git worktrees
- **Reviewable PRs**: Auto-stacked branches keep changes small and focused
- **Constitution versioning**: Architectural rules evolve explicitly with immutable history

## Architecture

### Plugin Structure

This is a Claude Code plugin with a standard structure:

```
spectacular/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json              # Plugin metadata and configuration
├── commands/                     # Slash commands (invoked with /spectacular:*)
│   ├── init.md                  # Environment setup and dependency validation
│   ├── spec.md                  # Feature specification generation
│   ├── plan.md                  # Task decomposition with dependency analysis
│   └── execute.md               # Parallel/sequential execution orchestration
└── skills/                       # Reusable process documentation
    ├── decomposing-tasks/       # Plan generation logic and quality rules
    ├── writing-specs/           # Spec creation patterns and anti-patterns
    ├── versioning-constitutions/ # Constitution evolution workflow
    └── using-git-spice/         # Stacked branch management patterns
```

### Command vs Skill

- **Commands** (`commands/*.md`): Entry points that users invoke with `/spectacular:*` slash commands. These are user-facing workflows.
- **Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`): Reusable process documentation invoked programmatically by commands or other skills using the Skill tool. These define HOW to do things.

### Core Workflow

1. **`/spectacular:init`** → Validates environment (superpowers, git-spice, git repo)
2. **`/spectacular:spec`** → Generates lean specification in `specs/{runId}-{feature-slug}/spec.md`
3. **`/spectacular:plan`** → Decomposes spec into execution plan with automatic phase grouping
4. **`/spectacular:execute`** → Orchestrates parallel/sequential implementation with git worktrees

## Development Commands

### Testing & Validation

This repository has **no traditional test/build commands** - it's pure markdown documentation for Claude Code.

**Validation approach:**
- Manual testing by invoking commands in a test repository
- Skills can be tested using the `testing-skills-with-subagents` skill from superpowers
- Changes should be validated by running the actual workflow in a sample project

### Plugin Development

**Installing locally for development:**
```bash
# Link to local plugins directory
ln -s /path/to/spectacular ~/.claude/plugins/cache/spectacular

# Or copy to plugins directory
cp -r . ~/.claude/plugins/cache/spectacular
```

**Reloading changes:**
- Claude Code reads plugin files on-demand
- Command/skill changes take effect immediately (no restart needed)
- Plugin metadata changes (plugin.json) may require restart

### Version Management

**Release (bump + push):**
```bash
pnpm release:patch    # 1.1.0 → 1.1.1 + push
pnpm release:minor    # 1.1.0 → 1.2.0 + push
pnpm release:major    # 1.1.0 → 2.0.0 + push
```

**Just bump (no push):**
```bash
pnpm version patch    # 1.1.0 → 1.1.1
pnpm version minor    # 1.1.0 → 1.2.0
pnpm version major    # 1.1.0 → 2.0.0
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. Updates `package.json` version
2. Runs `scripts/sync-version.js` to sync to `.claude-plugin/*.json`
3. Creates git commit with version bump
4. Creates git tag (e.g., `v1.1.1`)
5. Pushes to remote (if using `release:*` scripts)

## Key Concepts

### Specifications vs Plans

- **Specification** (`spec.md`): Defines WHAT to build and WHY
  - Requirements, architecture, acceptance criteria
  - References constitutions, links to external docs
  - NO implementation steps or task breakdown
  - Generated by `writing-specs` skill

- **Plan** (`plan.md`): Defines HOW and WHEN to implement
  - Task breakdown with file dependencies
  - Automatic phase grouping (sequential/parallel)
  - Time estimates and parallelization savings
  - Generated by `decomposing-tasks` skill

### Constitutions

**Constitutions** are immutable snapshots of architectural truth stored in `docs/constitutions/`:

- **meta.md** - Version metadata, changelog, and rationale
- **architecture.md** - Layer boundaries and project structure
- **patterns.md** - Mandatory patterns (e.g., skill format, TodoWrite usage, RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- **tech-stack.md** - Required dependencies and tools
- **schema-rules.md** - File naming and directory structure conventions
- **testing.md** - Validation approach for documentation-only project

Constitutions are **versioned** (v1/, v2/, etc.) with a `current/` symlink pointing to active version. Use the `versioning-constitutions` skill to create new versions when architectural rules change.

**Current version:** v1 establishes plugin architecture, commands vs skills separation, superpowers integration patterns, and git-spice workflows. See `docs/constitutions/current/meta.md` for details.

### Task Chunking Philosophy

Tasks should be **PR-sized, thematically coherent units** - not mechanical file-by-file splits.

**Good chunking:**
- M (3-5h): Sweet spot - complete subsystem, layer, or feature slice
- L (5-7h): Complex coherent units (full UI layer, complete API surface)
- S (1-2h): Rare - only truly standalone work

**Avoid:**
- XL tasks (>8h): Always split into M/L tasks
- Too many S tasks (>30%): Bundle related work into M tasks
- Mechanical splits: Schema + migration + dependencies should be ONE task ("Database Foundation")

### Parallel Execution with Worktrees

The `execute` command uses **git worktrees** for true parallel isolation:

1. Setup subagent creates worktrees for independent tasks
2. Implementation subagents work in isolated directories simultaneously
3. Each subagent creates its own branch with `gs branch create`
4. Cleanup subagent removes worktrees and creates linear stack
5. Code review validates integration

**Critical:** Parallel task subagents MUST `git switch --detach` after creating branches to make them accessible in parent repo.

### Git-Spice Stacking

All work is organized as **stacked branches** using [git-spice](https://github.com/abhinav/git-spice):

- Sequential tasks stack linearly: `task-1 → task-2 → task-3`
- Parallel tasks branch from same base, then stack for review
- No "feature branch" - the stack of task branches IS the feature
- Submit entire feature as stacked PRs with `gs stack submit`

See `using-git-spice` skill for command reference and workflows.

### Run IDs

Every execution has a **Run ID** (6-char hash) that namespaces branches and directories:

- Spec directory: `specs/{runId}-{feature-slug}/`
- Branch naming: `{runId}-task-1-2-database-schema`
- Filtering: `git branch | grep "^  {runId}-"`
- Enables multiple features to be developed simultaneously without branch name conflicts

## Editing Commands and Skills

### Command Structure

Commands are markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: One-line description shown to users
---

{Detailed instructions for Claude Code}
```

**Key principles:**
- Commands orchestrate workflows but delegate actual work to skills
- Use clear step-by-step instructions
- Include error handling and recovery steps
- Reference skills explicitly (e.g., "Use the `requesting-code-review` skill")

### Skill Structure

Skills are markdown files following the superpowers format:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: When to use this skill
---

# Skill Title

## When to Use
{Trigger conditions}

**Announce:** "I'm using {skill-name} to {purpose}."

## The Process
{Step-by-step workflow}

## Quality Rules
{Standards and validation}

## Error Handling
{Common failures and recovery}
```

**Key principles:**
- Skills are process documentation, not code
- Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: Assume Claude will rationalize away rules
- Include "Rationalization Table" for predictable shortcuts
- Add TodoWrite checklists for critical steps
- Test with `testing-skills-with-subagents` before deployment

### Maintaining Quality

When editing commands/skills:

1. **Read existing patterns**: All skills follow superpowers conventions
2. **Preserve rigor**: Don't soften rules to make them "easier" - rigor prevents bugs
3. **Test before committing**: Run the workflow in a sample project
4. **Version carefully**: Commands/skills are load-bearing - changes affect all users

## Dependencies

**Required:**
- [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) plugin - Core skills library (TDD, debugging, code review)
- [git-spice](https://github.com/abhinav/git-spice) - Stacked branch management
- Git repository - All workflows assume git

**Validated by `/spectacular:init` command**

## Common Workflows

### Creating a New Command

1. Create `commands/{command-name}.md` with description frontmatter
2. Write orchestration steps (delegate to skills, don't implement directly)
3. Test command in a sample project
4. Update `commands/README.md` if it exists

### Creating a New Skill

1. Create `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` with name/description frontmatter
2. Follow superpowers skill template (When to Use, The Process, Quality Rules, Error Handling)
3. Add rationalization table for predictable shortcuts
4. Test with `testing-skills-with-subagents` skill
5. Include TodoWrite checklists if skill has sequential steps

### Updating Constitution Workflow

If changing how constitutions work:

1. Read `skills/versioning-constitutions/SKILL.md` carefully
2. Test changes don't break immutability guarantees
3. Update documentation in README.md if user-facing

## File Naming Conventions

- Commands: Lowercase with hyphens: `init.md`, `execute.md`
- Skills: Lowercase with hyphens: `decomposing-tasks/`, `writing-specs/`
- Specs: `{runId}-{feature-slug}/spec.md` where runId is 6-char hash
- Plans: `{runId}-{feature-slug}/plan.md` (same directory as spec)
- Branches: `{runId}-task-{phase}-{task}-{short-name}` (e.g., `a1b2c3-task-1-2-install-tsx`)

## Integration with Superpowers

Spectacular **extends** superpowers, not replaces it. Key superpowers skills used:

- `brainstorming` - Refines ideas before spec creation
- `test-driven-development` - Write test first, watch fail, minimal code
- `systematic-debugging` - Four-phase debugging framework
- `requesting-code-review` - Dispatch code-reviewer after each phase
- `verification-before-completion` - Evidence before assertions
- `finishing-a-development-branch` - Complete work and choose next action
- `using-git-worktrees` - Parallel task isolation
- `subagent-driven-development` - Context-isolated task execution

**Never recreate superpowers workflows - reference and use them.**

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### In Specs
- ❌ Duplicating constitution rules (reference them instead)
- ❌ Including code examples from libraries (link to docs)
- ❌ Creating implementation plans (use `/spectacular:plan`)
- ❌ Adding success metrics or timelines (those are product docs)

### In Plans
- ❌ XL tasks (>8h) - always split into M/L
- ❌ Too many S tasks (>30%) - bundle into thematic M tasks
- ❌ Wildcard file patterns (`src/**/*.ts`) - use explicit paths
- ❌ Circular dependencies - review task organization

### In Execution
- ❌ Orchestrator running git commands directly (delegate to subagents)
- ❌ Creating empty "feature branch" upfront (stack IS the feature)
- ❌ Parallel tasks forgetting to detach HEAD (breaks worktree cleanup)
- ❌ Skipping quality gates (tests, linting, code review)

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
- Verify file is in `commands/` directory
- Check YAML frontmatter has `description` field
- Restart Claude Code if plugin.json was changed

### Skill Not Loading
- Verify file is at `skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
- Check YAML frontmatter has `name` and `description`
- Use Skill tool with exact skill name

### Worktree Creation Fails
- Check `.worktrees/` is in `.gitignore`
- Run `git worktree prune` to clean stale entries
- Verify working directory is clean

### Git-Spice Errors
- Run `gs repo init` to initialize repository
- Check `gs ls` to view current stack
- See `using-git-spice` skill for troubleshooting
